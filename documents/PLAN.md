Real Estate TODO

App used to track Real estate Agent TODO list which helps in selling the property or maintaing him
There can be another user journey, i,e is a client planing to buy a property, bit for now we are not
considering that senario and sticking only with agent 


in our use case 
"main-task" represents the property
"sub-task" represents the process of selling or maintaing the property 

Primary Feature we are concentrating on (applies for both main-task and sub-task )
1. ADD / EDIT / DELETE of both 
2. Adding Image 
3. Adding location
   a. in case of main-task we call it as verify property ( where a person has to be upload current location from GPS )
4. Pre-define label so that it can be used later for filtering 
5. Geo Fencing to show alerts on the bases of current user location 
6. Filtering of main-task and sub-task based on label 


Good To Have 
1. Filtering the main-task based on current gelocation 
2. Actution on property
